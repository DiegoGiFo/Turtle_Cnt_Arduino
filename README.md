# Turtlesim Controller

This project allows to controll the Turtlesim of ROS by Arduino.
tthe goal is to do this creating a subsriber and a publisher.

_The project Button and H_W_LCD allows me to better understand how to implement the final project_

## INFO

- On folder [Vs_1](https://github.com/DiegoGiFo/Turtle_Cnt_Arduino/tree/master/Vs_1) there is a scripts that allows to controll the turtle sim only with the Arduino (**NO LCD screen or something else is needed**).
- On folder [Vs_2](https://github.com/DiegoGiFo/Turtle_Cnt_Arduino/tree/master/Vs_2) there is a scripts that allows to controll the turtle sim only with the Arduino through 4 buttons. On the LCD screen is showed the position of the turtle.
